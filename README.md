High level approaches/designs for the Welups<->Ethereum bridge project
======================================================================

This repo is meant to eventually be a documentation of the design, and not just a document
for some proposal solution, since the design would probably change a lot during the earlier
stages of the project, i.e. the design itself is a work in progress and it's a good idea
to revision-control it.
